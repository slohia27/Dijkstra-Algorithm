# Dijkstra-Algorithm

Firstly, I had to implement the method computeEuclideanDistance() which calculated the
	distance between cities using the distance formula.Then I used computeAllEuclideanDistances by using 
	the first method and applying it to the entire collect vertex.
	
	In the method doDijkstra(String s) I had implement Dijkstra's algorithm starting at the city with name s
		I did this by using the psuedocode the book provided.
	I then had to implement the method getDijkstraPath(String s, String t), 
		which called doDijstra(s) and then used the distance and prev instance variables to locate the shortest path

Also I wanted to note that since I was having errors in my Display class I had to adjust settings in my IDE
	and thus also make some changes to my Display class.
